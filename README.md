# This Is A Work In Progress
Please do not mind this.
this was meant to be a private repo with a private key, but with how github api works, private repositories with keys have stricter rules that unfortunately wont work for me.
Public repositories have different rules, these rules work, as this was meant to be private, i plan for all actuall 'code' to be encrypted with a private key.
Anything here can change, ill ignore all contributions unless otherwise stated here.
This readme is the best source of info.
Anyway please move on, most of this is for people who will actually use this (people with the key), and should be ignored by anybody else.
